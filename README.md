# Shiny Gold Sigma: Angle Edition

## what and why?

shiny gold sigma is an excellent game with tons and tons of content. it is in my opinion the definitive way to play gen iii gba johto/kanto.

due to being based on gold, however, shiny gold sigma has some issues. most notably, the level curve is absolutely busted, with wild pokemon being at absurdly low levels. furthermore, shiny gold sigma boosts the trainer difficulty, so the only way to beat them usually requires a lot of grinding. and since all the wild pokemon are leveled so low, this turns into an extremely tedious loop of grinding against pokemon 10+ levels below you.

this mod/hack builds on the greatness of shiny gold sigma by simply ironing such issues. this mod should greatly smoothen the experience of playing shiny gold sigma!

## key goals
+ full save compatibility with base shiny gold sigma
+ improved level curve of pokemon to reduce grinding
