## goals
- i want to recurve the busted curve that requires grinding
- im going to note areas where the curve spikes like this

## findings so far

- dark cave has very low level pkmn, despite it being after faulkner (who enables flash). faulkner's highest pkmn is level 14. i think dark cave levels should be around 6-12.
- slowpoke well has very low level pkmn. i think it should be around lv 10-12 on avg.
- ilex forest pkmn underleveled, make all 10-11 ish
- natpark low level
